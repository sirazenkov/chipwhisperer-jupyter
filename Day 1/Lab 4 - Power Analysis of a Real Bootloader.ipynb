You can find a link to the [datasheet PDF here](https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/info/docget.jsp?did=10173&prodName=TMP91FW27UG), or there is a local copy on the USB stick.\n",

Different manufactures use different technologies or words.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to talk to the bootloader, we included a TMP91FW27UG target board. This board includes the TMP91FW27UG microcontroller. You can see the schematic and design for this board [here](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-target-cw308t/tree/main/CW312T_TMP91FW) if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important points about the pinout are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The clock is driven from the ChipWhisperer, using the normal \"clkgen\" output.\n",
    "2. The serial is connected as `tio1 = \"serial_tx\"`, `tio2 = \"serial_rx\"`\n",
    "3. The BOOT pin is `pdic`, set it low (`False` or `0`) for bootloader, high (`True` or `1`) for normal boot\n",
    "\n",
    "The following small snippets may be helpful: one shows how to calculate the checksum required, the other sends a command and returns the response. The response is returned in two formats (sometimes you'll want one or the other).\n",
