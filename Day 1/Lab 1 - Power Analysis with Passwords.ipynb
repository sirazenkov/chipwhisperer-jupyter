    "\n",

    "// change correct_passwd[] to correct_passwd[32]\n",
    "// make sure not to use the length of the correct password to avoid leaking password length\n",

    "Another fix is to use a secure hash function, such as SHA256, to transform the correct and submitted passwords before comparing them. This has the advantage of not requiring the firmware to store the correct password, just its hash. Passwords are often combined with \"salt\" to protect against additional attacks."
