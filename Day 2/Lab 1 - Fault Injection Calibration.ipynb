    "`clock_only`, `clock_xor`, and `clock_or` are mostly useful when clock glitching - trying to oscillate the Vcc pin like that is way too strong. `glitch_only` and `enable_only` can both be useful when glitching, but generally lend themselves to different strategies. If you're glitching without a target clock, you can crank up `scope.clock.clkgen_freq` and bypass the 50% restriction on the phase shift blocks. For this lab, however, we'll be using `glitch_only`, as we want to make use of the `width` and `offset` blocks and a 50% width is plenty strong enough to glitch this target."
